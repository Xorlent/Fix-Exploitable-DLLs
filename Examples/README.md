# Fix-Exploitable-DLLs Example Mitigation XML Files
Example mitigation XML files for Windows 10 or Windows 11 computers.  

### Examples
  In this directory you will find a Windows 10 and Windows 11 XML configuration file with mitigations applied.  These files can be used to quickly test remediation without the need to run the script.  Ideally. you would test these XML cofigurations on a standard desktop deployment image, verifying all works well, then use the final resulting configuration XML to deploy to your desktop fleet.  [Microsoft guidance for exporting, importing, deploying mitigations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/import-export-exploit-protection-emet-xml?view=o365-worldwide)

### Preparation
  - Always take a backup or, at the very least, create a System Restore point before applying mitigations

### Importing an example XML
  - Download the example XML file to import
  - Right-click on the downloaded file and select Properties
  - Click "Unblock," then "OK"
  - Open an Administrator Powershell window
  - Exchanging filename.xml for the actual file you will be importing, execute:  
    ```Set-ProcessMitigation -PolicyFilePath filename.xml```

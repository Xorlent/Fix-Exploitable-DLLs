# Fix-Exploitable-DLLs
PowerShell script to find, report, and mitigate (where possible) EXEs with exploitable DLLs  
If a vulnerable DLL is properly code-signed, the script will auto-remediate the vulnerability
  
#### This project uses [Wietze's Hijacklibs](https://github.com/wietze/HijackLibs) data to scan for vulnerabilities.  Many thanks!
